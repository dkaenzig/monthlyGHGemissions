# Monthly EU GHG emissions

Repository hosing the monthly EU GHG emisssion data from Känzig (2023). 

The GHG emissions data is temporally disaggregated based on the Chow Lin (1971) approach, using petroleum and other fossil fuels consumption, industrial production and harmonized consumer prices (energy and headline) as monthly indicators. For more details, see the appendix in Känzig (2023).

The data set is updated at an annual frequency, when new emissions data becomes available.
